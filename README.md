# ananorc

Some colors I like.  
First archived by anson in January 2025.

In the past month I have reinstalled my operating system twice already,
and while I usually have a small amount of stuff to backup and otherwise
archive just in case of something like, having to reinstall my operating
system, I actually did not back up my .nanorc files, which is a bit of a
pain to set up every time.

In case of emergency, I will host the .nanorc files I use for the most
common languages that I write in for backup, which can be ammended at
anytime in the future to fix some syntax, or to add even more languages.
I invite anyone out there to use these files to supplement their other
.nanorc files.

The general color scheme that most of these files output is deliberately
based off of the color scheme found in the .jsf (Joe editor syntax highlighting)
files used by Joel Yliluoma AKA [Bisqwit](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/), as
featured in *[That Editor](https://github.com/bisqwit/that_editor)*, also
created by him.
